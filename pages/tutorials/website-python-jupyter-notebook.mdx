# Turn Jupyter Notebook into Website in 3 minutes

Would you like to quickly turn your Python notebook into static website? It is very easy with Mercury framework.

You need to do simple 3 steps:
1. [Install Mercury](/docs/installation) framework.
2. Add code cell with [`App`](/docs/input-widgets/app/) object and set `static_notebook=True` in constructor.
3. Run notebook in Mercury.

## 1. Install Mercury

You can read more [here](/docs/installation/) about different ways to install Mercury package.

The easiest way is to run:

```
pip install mercury 
```

## 2. Set `App` object with `static_notebook=True`

Please open the notebook that you would like to convert to a static website. You need to add following code in it:

```python
import mercury as mr

# configure App properties
app = mr.App(title="Static notebook", description="Display static notebook", static_notebook=True)
```

Please set `static_notebook=True` - it will do the magic!

#### Example notebook

## 3. Run Mercury

The last step is to run Mercury Server. Please run the following command:

```
mercury run
```

You should see in the web browser at address `http://127.0.0.1:8000` a website like in the image below:

In the above screenshot only one notebook is served. Please click in the notebook title and you will see selected notebook website:

You can download notebook as PDF or HTML format.

### Additional notes

- You can share as many notebooks as you want in Mercury (see [docs](/docs/multiple-notebooks/)).
- You can easily customize [welcome message](/docs/welcome/) in the home view.
- If you want to [show notebook code](/docs/show-hide-code-notebook), please add `show_code=True` in `App` constructor.
