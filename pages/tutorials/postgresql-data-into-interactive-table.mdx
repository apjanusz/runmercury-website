# Display PostgreSQL data as an interactive table in Jupyter Notebook using Python

## Retrieve data from PostgreSQL

You will need following packages:

```python
mercury
pandas
psycopg2
dotenv
os
```
- `mercury`  is a package for turning notebooks to web apps.
- `pandas`  is for data manipulation.
- `psycopg2`  allows to connect with the database.
- `dotenv`  is for storing secrets.
- `os`  allows to do basic system operations.

Make sure that you have installed them before start doing anything.

### 1. Import packages

Firstly, install required packages:

```python
import mercury as mr
import pandas as pd
import psycopg2 as ps
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
```

### 2. Connect with database

Then, create a function which allows to connect with database: 

```python
load_dotenv()
def db_engine():
    host = os.environ.get("DB_HOST")
    port = os.environ.get("DB_POST")
    user = os.environ.get("DB_USERNAME")
    password = os.environ.get("DB_PASSWORD")
    db = os.environ.get("DB_DATABASE")
    
    return f"user='{user}' password='{password}' host='{host}' port='{port}' dbname='{db}'"
```

To keep credentials safe we use **dotenv** method.

You can get more information about in our article: [**3 ways to access credentials in Jupyter Notebook**](https://mljar.com/blog/jupyter-notebook-credentials/)

After that, connect with your database. Use **try** block to detect possible errors.

```python 
try:
    conn = ps.connect(db_engine())
except Exception as e:
    print(f"problems: {e}")
```

### 3. Send queries

Now, you have to create a queries using SQL. Here an example query:

```python
query = "select username, id, email, last_login::date, date_joined::date from auth_user;"
```

### 4. Get responses

To get responses update **try** block:

```python
try:
    conn = ps.connect(db_engine())
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute(query)
    response = cur.fetchall()
    cur.close()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"problems: {e}")
```

- `cur = conn.cursor()` creates a cursor that allows your program to move around your database.
- `cur.execute()`  sends your query.
- `cur.fetchall()` gets a response for your query.
- `cur.close()` closes a cursor.

## Turn data into an interactive table

After you got all of needed information from the database, it's time to display them as an interactive table.

Convert your Data into DataFrame using `pandas` :

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(response, columns=['Username', 'ID', 'Email', 'Last login', 'Data joined',])
```

It's important to name all of colums, no more, no less.

Next, use **Table** *Mercury Widget* to create an interactive table. Write following code:

```python
mr.Table(data=df, width="auto")
```

- `data` is a name of DataFrame which you want to show in table.
- `width` sets width of columns in table.

## Result

After all, your code should look like this:

### Create a site

You have to create site. If you have any problems with it, get more information in our [docs](../docs/cloud).

### Upload files

Then, you need to upload your notebook. Click `Upload files` button on your site dashboard. 

<Screenshot src={sitedashboardPng} alt="From site dashboard to uploadfiles." />

Then, choose file which you want to upload and confirm it.

### Share your site

After all, it should look like this: 

<Screenshot src={cloudPng} alt="Result in Mercury Cloud" />

*We blured username and email columns for legal reasons.*

Now you can share your site with other users!
