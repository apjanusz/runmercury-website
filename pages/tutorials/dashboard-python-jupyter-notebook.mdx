# Create dashboard with Python in 10 Jupyter Notebook cells

In this tutorial we will create a simple financial dashboard. Code development will be performed in the Jupyter Notebook. 
The resulting notebook will be served with Mercury as a dashboard. Python code will be hidden. 

In the dashboard there will be stock infomation. The DataFrame with last data and candle plot from last 3 months.
We will use one Mercury Widget: [`Select`](/docs/input-widgets/select/) for choosing stock.

## Create a notebook

We will need following packages:

```
yfinance
mplfinance
mercury
```

- `yfinance` is package to fetch latest stock data,
- `mplfinance` is matplotlib addin with financial charts,
- `mercury` is a package for turning notebooks to web apps.

Please make sure that you have installed them.

### 1. Import packages

In the frist cell, we will import required packages:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import mplfinance as mpf
import mercury as mr
```


### 2. Setup Mercury App 

In the second cell, we will setup Mercury App properties:

- `title` - it will appear in the sidebar,
- `description` - it will appear in the home view.

```python
app = mr.App(title="Financial dashboard", description="Dashboard with financial data")
```

<Callout type="info">
    We don't set `show_code` parameter in [`App`](/docs/input-widgets/app/) object, because by default it is set to `False`. 
    If you would like to show code in your notebook, please set `show_code=True`.
</Callout>

### 3. Add title

Please add a Markdown cell with a header:

```
# Historic stock price üìà
```

### 4. Add Mercury Select


In the next cell, we will add a [`Select`](/docs/input-widgets/select/) widget:

```python 
ticker = mr.Select(value="TSLA", 
                   choices=["TSLA", "COIN", "MSFT", "PLTR", "SNOW", "NFLX"], 
                   label="Select stock")
```

Please note, that it will display widget in the notebook. You can interact with it. 
There are no other actions performed in the notebook. Only value of the widget is updated.

### 5. Load historic stock data 

We will load the data with `yfinance` package:

```python 
history = yf.Ticker(ticker.value).history(period="3mo")
```

That's all. It is done with 1 line of code. 

The value of the widget is obtained with `ticket.value`.

### 6. Display basic statistics 

We will create a Markdown text with Python variables. Let's use [`Md`](/docs/output-widgets/markdown/) from Mercury:

```python
mr.Md(f"""## Basic statistics
#### 3 months low: {history.Low.min().astype(int)}
#### 3 months high: {history.High.max().astype(int)}""")
```

The above code will display Markdown text.

### 7. Add subtitle

Please add a Markdown cell with subtitle:

```
## Last days data
```

### 8. Display historic data

Let's display the last rows from `history` DataFrame:

```python 
history.tail()
```

### 9. Add subtitle 

Please add a Makdown cell:

```
## Candle chart üïØÔ∏è
```

### 10. Display candle plot

We will use `mplfinance` to easily create candle plot:

```python
mpf.plot(history, type='candle', mav=(7),figratio=(18,10))
```

Here is presented notebook with dashboard code:

<Callout type="info">
    You can interact with Mercury Widgets in the notebook. Widgets values will be updated. There are no othe actions peformed. 
    If you would like to update cells with new widget's values. Please execute cell manually.

    When you run notebook in Mercury, cells below widgets definition are automatically re-executed.
</Callout>

## Dashboard in Mercury

The last step is to run notebook in Mercury. Please run the following command in the directory where notebook is saved:

```
mercury run
```

It will open a web browser at address `http://1270.0.1:8000`. You should see a card with `Financial dashboard` title. Please click on the title.

You can play with the dashboard. Please change the stock, the results should be automatically updated:

Mercury has option to export executed notebook to PDF or HTML. It is very simple. Please click `Download` button in the sidebar and select desired format:
