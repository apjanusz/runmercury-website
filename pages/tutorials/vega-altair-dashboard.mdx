# Build dashboard with Vega-Altair and Python

The [Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a great package for building interactive visualizations. I would like to show you how to use it in Jupyter Notebook.
What is more, we will publish Python notebook as a web application thanks to the Mercury framework.

Here is a preview of the notebook and the dashboard:
<Screenshot src={appGif} alt="Dashboard created in Mercury from Python notebook" />

## Import packages

We will need the following packages:

```
mercury
altair
vega_datasets
```

- `mercury` will be used to create interactive widgets and publish notebook as web app,
- `altair` is a plotting package,
- `vega_datasets` is a package with example datasets.

The import cell code:

```python
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data
import mercury as mr
```

## Setup app properties

In the next cell, we will setup [`App`](/docs/input-widgets/app/) properties:

```python
app = mr.App(title="Car report ðŸ“Š", description="Report based on cars dataset")
```

The `title` and `description` will be used for displaying information about app in the home view (when served with Mercury):
<Screenshot src={homeViewPng} alt="Home View with many notebooks served with Mercury" />

## Load data

We will use `cars` dataset from `vega_datasets` package:

```python
cars = data.cars()
```

## Select samples based on widget selection

Let's add [`MultiSelect`](/docs/input-widgets/multiselect/) widget to choose origin of cars:

```python
origin = mr.MultiSelect(label="Select origin", value=cars.Origin.unique(), choices=cars.Origin.unique())
```

We will use selection `.value` to filter Data Frame:

```python
df = cars[cars.Origin.isin(origin.value)]
```

## Checkbox to control plots

We will add [`CheckBox`](/docs/input-widgets/checkbox/) to control number of plots:

```python
show_bars = mr.Checkbox(label="Show bars plot", value=True)
```

## Display metrics

Metrics about data can be displayed with [`NumberBox`](/docs/output-widgets/numberbox/) widget:

```python 
mr.NumberBox([
    mr.NumberBox(data=df.shape[0], title="Total cars"),
    mr.NumberBox(data=df.Horsepower.max(), title="Max Horse Power"),
    mr.NumberBox(data=df.Miles_per_Gallon.max(), title="Max MPG"),
])
```

## Create Vega-Altair plots

Please use the following code to create plots about `cars` data:

```python
points = alt.Chart(df).mark_point().encode(
    x='Horsepower:Q',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon:Q',
    color='Origin:N',
    tooltip=['Name', 'Origin', 'Horsepower', 'Miles_per_Gallon']
).interactive().properties(
    width="container"
)

bars = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x='count()',
    y='Origin:N',
    color='Origin:N'
).properties(
    width="container"
)

charts = [points]
if show_bars.value:
    charts += [bars]

alt.vconcat(
    *charts
).configure(autosize="fit-x")
```

## Display Data Frame samples 

Please call `head()` functtion to display first 20 samples from our data:
```python
df.head(20)
```

Here is full code in the Jupyter Notebook:
<Screenshot src={notebookGif} alt="Dashboard with Vega-Altair in Jupyter Notebook" />

<Callout type="info">
Please notice that during notebook development cells are not automatically re-executed after widget update. 
You need to manually execute cells after widget change in the Jupyter Notebook.

When serving notebook with Mercury, cells are automatically re-executed after widget change.
</Callout>

## Run as Web App

Please start Mercury Server with the following command:

```
mercury run
```

You should see the Web App running at address `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Below is an example demo:

## Deployment

There are several ways that you can use to deploy apps created in the Mercury. The simplest way is to use [Mercury Cloud](https://cloud.runmercury.com). 
It is a hosting service, where you can deploy notebooks as web apps with few clicks. The app from the tutorial is available at this address [use-cases.runmercury.com](https://use-cases.runmercury.com/).

There are several options for self-hosting Mercury. Please check [documentation](/docs/) for details.
