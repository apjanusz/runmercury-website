# Web App with Jupyter Notebook in 2 steps

We will create a web application with Jupyter Notebook and Mercury. We will do this in 2 steps:

1. We will create a Python notebook in Jupyter Notebook. 
2. We will serve notebook `hello-world.ipynb` as web app with Mercury. 

We will use Mercury Widgets to make notebook interactive. You will be able to use widgets during the notebook development and in Mercury.

Please make sure that you [installed Mercury package](/docs/installation/):

```
pip install mercury
```

You will also need `matplotlib` package.

## Create Python Notebook

Let's create a new notebook `hello-world.ipynb`. 

<Callout type="info">
    When creating a new notebook, please make sure that you have selected Python kernel with `mercury` package installed.
</Callout>


The first cell will import needed packages:

```python
import mercury as mr # for widgets
import random # for random data generation
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt # for chart
```

In the second cell, we will configure Mercury [`App`](/docs/input-widgets/app/) properties: `title` and `description`:

```python
app = mr.App(title="Hello in Mercury!", description="Samples app in Mercury")
```

In the `App` object you can also decide to show or hide notebook's code. 
The default is set to hide code. Please add `show_code=True` argument in the constructor to show code in Mercury App.

After executing this cell you will get information about `Mercury Application`, don't worry about it. It will not be displayed in Mercury App.

The next cell is Markdown type. It is a simple header:

```md
# Hello in Mercury! ðŸ‘‹
```

In the following cell, we will add Mercury Widgets:

```python
name = mr.Text(label="What is your name?", value="Piotr")
points = mr.Slider(label="Number of points", value=75, min=50, max=100)
color = mr.Select(label="Select color", value="blue", choices=["red", "green", "blue"])
```

Please note, that after cell execution widgets are displayed. 
You can interact with them. Their values will be changed. However, no additional actions are performed.

Let's add a Markdown text with value of the `name` widget:

```python
mr.Md(f"""## How are you {name.value}?
You can mix Python code and Markdown.""")
```

We have used [`Md`](/docs/output-widgets/markdown/) to create Markdown with Python variables. The `name.value` is returing the value of `mr.Text` widget.

In the last code cell, we will do a `matplotlib` chart:

```python
x = [random.gauss(0,1) for _ in range(points.value)]
y = [random.gauss(0,1) for _ in range(points.value)]
_ = plt.plot(x,y, '*', markersize=14, color=color.value)
_ = plt.title(f"Plot for {name.value}")
```

We are using `points.value` and `color.value` to access widgets' values.

## Run Mercury App

Please run the following command in the same directory as your `hello-world.ipynb` notebook:

```
mercury run
```

The Mercury will detect **all** notebooks in the current directory. It will start a local server. 
You can open a web browser at address `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see Mercury app. Please open the notebook with title `Hello in Mercury!`.


You will see the app similar as in the animation below. You can play with widgets values and the notebook output displayed on the right side will be automatically updated.

You can change code in the Jupyter Notebook (rember to save it) and Mercury will detect file change and will update the app instantly.


Example ways you can use to customize and extend your app:
- Set custom [welcome message](/docs/welcome/).
- Use more [input widgets](/docs/input-widgets/) and [output widgets](/docs/output-widgets/).
