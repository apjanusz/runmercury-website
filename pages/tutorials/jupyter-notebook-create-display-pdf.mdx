# How to create and display PDF in Jupyter Notebook using Python

## Create a PDF

You will need following packages: 
```
reportlab
mercury
```
- `reportlab` allows to create a PDF etc.
- `mercury` is a package for turning notebooks to web apps.

Make sure that you have installed them before start doing anything.

### 1. Import packages

First of all, you have to install required packages:

```python 
import mercury as mr
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
```

### 2. Create a file 

Next, you have to create a PDF and name it. 

```python 
pdf_file = canvas.Canvas("example.pdf")
```

- `pdf_file` is a variable's name.
- `Canvas` is a function which allows to create a PDF.
- `example.pdf` is name which you would like to set to your file.

### 3. Add content

Then, it is time to add some content. You can add text by typing this code:

```python
pdf_file.setFont("Helvetica", 50)
pdf_file.drawString(180, 750, "Welcome!")
```

- `setFont` allows to set font family and size.
- `drawString` - first two variables are responsible for margins and third one is a place where you have to type text.

### 4. Save file

After filling your file with content, you have to save it. It will create a file in the current directory and save it in your program's memory. Please use this code:

```python
pdf_file.save()
```

## Display a PDF

All you have to do is add another cell and put in it this code:

```python
mr.PDF("example.pdf")
```

- `PDF` is a Mercury's widget which allows to display PDF files. Check our [PDF](../docs/output-widgets/pdf/) docs to get more information.
- `example.pdf` is name of file which you want to display

## Result 

After all, your code should look like this: 

<Screenshot src={fullcodePng} alt="Full code." />

*code to copy:*

```python
import mercury as mr
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
```
```python
pdf_file = canvas.Canvas("example.pdf")
pdf_file.setFont("Helvetica", 50)
pdf_file.drawString(180, 750, "Welcome!")
pdf_file.setFont("Helvetica", 20)
pdf_file.drawString(40, 700, "This in an example Notebook")
pdf_file.save()
```
```python
mr.PDF("example.pdf")
```

**And here is the result:**

<Screenshot src={resultPng} alt="PDF display." />

### Create a site

You have to create site. If you have any problems with it, get more information in our [docs](../docs/cloud).

### Upload files

Then, you need to upload your PDF. Click `Upload files` button on your site dashboard. 

<Screenshot src={sitedashboardPng} alt="From site dashboard to uploadfiles." />

Next, you have to upload 2 files: 
- **notebook** where you create and display a PDF
- **requirements.txt** file because you need not built-in package. Check how to create such a file [here](../docs/pip-install-requirements).

### Share your site

After all, it should look like this: 

<Screenshot src={cloudPng} alt="PDF on your Web App." />

Now you can share your site with other users!
