# Create reports with Python

In this tutorial, we are going to create a simple financial report for stock companies. The report will be generated based on the ticker and selected time period.
The report will consist of:

- basic statistics about the company,
- plot showing the historical prices,
- Data Frame with latest data.

Here is a preview of the notebook and ready report:

## Import required packages


We need to install the following packages:

```
mercury
pandas
yfinance
mplfinance
```

- `mercury` will be used for interactive widgets and for running notebook as a web app,
- `pandas` is for data manipulation,
- `yfinance` will be used for downloading historical financial data,
- `mplfinance` is a plotting package for financial data.

The cell code with imports is below:

```python
from datetime import date, timedelta
import yfinance as yf
import mercury as mr
import pandas as pd
import mplfinance as mpf
```

## Add interactive widgets

In the next three cells, we will setup web app properties (`title` and `description`) and add interactive widgets.

Please create the [`App`](/docs/input-widgets/app/) object to control app properties:

```python
app = mr.App(title="Ticker Report", description="Report financial data for selected ticker")
```

Then let's add [`Text`](/docs/input-widgets/text/) widget for ticker:

```python
ticker = mr.Text(label="Ticker", value="NVDA")
```

The [`Slider`](/docs/input-widgets/slider/) widget to control history length:

```python
weeks = mr.Slider(label="Weeks", value=52, min=4, max=260)
```

<Callout type="info">
Please notice that during the development of the notebook, nothing happens after the widget change. You can interact with the widget but to see changes in other cells you need to execute them manually,

When the notebook is served with `mercury` then cells are automatically re-executed after the widget update. Only cells below the updated widget are re-executed.
</Callout>


## Load data

Let's create a Data Frame with our data:

```python
start = date.today() - timedelta(weeks.value*7)
end = date.today() + timedelta(2)
df = pd.DataFrame(yf.download(ticker.value, start=start, end=end, progress=False))
```

## Display metrics

We can use [`NumberBox`](/docs/output-widgets/numberbox/) to display important metrics:

```python
mr.NumberBox([
    mr.NumberBox(data=ticker.value),
    mr.NumberBox(data=df.High.max().round(1), title=f"{weeks.value}-Week High"),
    mr.NumberBox(data=df.Low.min().round(1), title=f"{weeks.value}-Week Low")
])
```

## Display plot 

Ploting financial data with `mplfinance` is very easy:

```python
plot_type = "candle" if weeks.value < 53 else "line"
mpf.plot(df, type=plot_type, figratio=(18,10))
```

Please notice that we do a candle plot for short periods (less than 1 year) and a line plot for longer periods.

## Display Data Frame 

Call `tail(10)` on our Data Frame to display the latest 10 samples of data:

```python
df.tail(10)
```

Below is our notebook in the Jupyter:

## Run as a Web App

In the same directory as the notebook file, please start the `mercury` server with the below command:

```
mercury run
```

It will start the local server and publish all notebooks from the current directory as web applications. Please open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and check your app.

You can change the ticker value and control history with the slider:

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy notebooks is to use [Mercury Cloud](https://cloud.runmercury.com). Here is the app deployed in the Mercury Cloud: [use-cases.runmercury.com/app/ticker-report](https://use-cases.runmercury.com/app/ticker-report).

There are many options to self-host Mercury. Please check [documentation](/docs/) for more details.
