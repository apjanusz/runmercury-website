# Create reports with Python

Creating reports is similar to creating dashboard. 
Please check tutorial on how to [create dashboard with Mercury](/tutorials/dashboard-python-jupyter-notebook/).

Soon we will add features that will allow you to create amazing reporting systems:
- automatic notebook scheduling,
- sending executed notebook in PDF or HTML by email,
- authentication.

Those features were available in Mercury V1. 
The V2 is much different than V1 (widgets are added with Python code instead YAML). 
They will be available in V2 soon.
