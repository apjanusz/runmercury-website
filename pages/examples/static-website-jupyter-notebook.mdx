# Turn notebook to static website

You can turn Python notebooks to static websites. Please create [`App`](/docs/input-wdgets/app/) object with `satic_notebook=True`. 
This will display your notebook as a static website. What is more, you can control whether to show or hide code.

## Required packages

You need to install `mercury` package to run this example.

## Notebook

Import needed packages:

```python
import mercury as mr
```

Setup [`App`](/docs/input-widgets/app/) with `static_notebook=True`:

```python
app = mr.App(title="Static notebook",
             description="Display notebook as static website",
             show_code=True,
             static_notebook=True)
```

Other cells with code:

```python
a = 1

b = 2

print(f"a + b is {a+b}")
```

The screenshot with code:

<Screenshot src={notebookPng} alt="Python notebook with static option" />

## Mercury App

Please start Mercury in the same directory as notebook:

```
mercury run
```

When you open a notebook you should see:

<Screenshot src={appPng} alt="Mercury App with static notebook" />

The notebook can be downloaded as PDF or HTML file.

## Additional tips 

- You can hide sidebar by setting `app = mr.App(show_sidebar=False, ... other arguments )`.
- You can hide `Download` button in the sidebar by setting `app = mr.App(allow_download=False, ... other agruments)`.
- Mercury App display notebook in full screen mode. You can set `1140px` as width for notebook displayed in Mercury by setting `app = mr.App(full_screen=False, ... other arguments)`.

Please check [`App`](/docs/input-widgets/app/) documentation for details.
