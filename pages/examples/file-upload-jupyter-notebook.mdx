# File Upload 

Let's upload file to the Python Notebook. 

## Required packages 

You need to install `mercury` package to run this example.

## Notebook

Please import required packages:

```python
import mercury as mr
```

Let's add [`File`](/docs/input-widgets/file) upload widget:

```python
file = mr.File(label="File upload", max_file_size="10MB")
```

We can print uploaded file name and path (path will be temporary):

```python
print(f"Uploaded file name: {file.filename}")
print(f"Uploaded file path: {file.filepath}")
```

We can read file as normal file:

```python
if file.filepath is not None:
    with open(file.filepath, "r") as fin:
        print(fin.read())
```

It is important to check if `filepath` is not `None` before reading the file. The `filepath` attribute will be set after file is uploaded.

The screenshot of the notebook's code in the Jupyter Notebook:

## Mercury App

Please start Mercury in the same directory as your notebook:

```
mercury run
```

You should see app running at address: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
