# Pivot Table 

In this example, you will learn how to create a web app that can do pivot table on CSV data uploaded by user. 

We will use custom widget [`pivottablejs`](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/jupyter_pivottablejs) to create pivot table. It is compatible with Jupyter Notebook/Lab and Mercury.

The dataset will be loaded from CSV file with [`File`](/input-widgets/file/) widget from Mercury.
The notebook and  and web app are presented in the below animation.

## Required packages

You will need the following packages to run this example:

```
mercury
pandas
pivottablejs
```

- `mercury` is for file upload widget and for serving notebook as web app,
- `pandas` is for reading CSV file,
- `pivottablejs` is for displaying pivot table user interface.

## Notebook

In the first cell, please import required packages:

```python
import pandas as pd
import mercury as mr
from pivottablejs import pivot_ui
```

Let's setup Mercury app properties:

```python
app = mr.App(title="Pivot table", 
             description="Do pivot table on any CSV file")
```

File upload widget is added with one line of code:

```python
my_file = mr.File(label="Upload CSV file")
```

We stop the execution of the notebook until file is uploaded. We use [`Stop`](/output-widgets/stop/) widget to stop execution of the notebook.

```python
if my_file.filepath is None:
    mr.Markdown("Please upload CSV file")
    mr.Stop()
```

We load the dataset with `pandas` package:

```python
# load CSV data
df = pd.read_csv(my_file.filepath)
```

The pivot table for our DataFrame is displayed with the following code:

```python
# display pivot table 
pivot_ui(df, height="800px")
```

You can analyze your DataFrame with pivot table in the Jupyter Notebook. Here is the screenshot with code in Jupyter Notebook:

## Mercury App

You can share your notebook to non-technical users. They will be able to upload their dataset in CSV format and perform analysis with pivot table (you will make them happy!).

Please start Mercury Server in the same directory as notebook:

```
mercury run
```

You will see the app running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You will see a home view with your notebook. Please click on its title.
You should see the web app running. After uploading example CSV file you should see app similar as in the screenshot below:

Notebook from this example is available in the [mercury-examples](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-examples/tree/main/pivot-table) repository.
