# Show and hide code in Jupyter Notebook Web App

You can control whether to show or hide code of your notebook in Mercury App. 
It is done by setting `show_code` argument when contructing [`App`](/docs/input-widgets/app) object.

## Required packages 

You need to install `mercury` package to run this example.

## Notebook 

Please import required package in the first cell:

```python
import mercury as mr
```

We will add [`Checkbox`](/docs/input-widgets/checkbox) to control code visibility:

```python
show_code = mr.Checkbox(value=True, label="Show code")
```

The widget will be displayed in the notebook. The next step, is to add `app` object:

```python 
app = mr.App(title="Show or hide code", 
             description="You can show and hide code in this app",
             show_code=show_code.value)
```

We setup:
- `title` - will be used in the sidebar,
- `description` - will be used in the home view,
- `show_code` - control code visibility.

Let's add some example code:

```python
print("Example code ...")
```

The screenshot with notebook's code in Jupyter Notebook:

## Mercury App

Let's run Mercury in the same directory as our notebook:

```
mercury run
```

Please open web browser at address `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You should be able to open Mercury App.
You can play with `show_code` checkbox:
