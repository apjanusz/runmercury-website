# Load on click

We will load dataset on button click in this example. Data is loaded only when button is clicked.

## Required packages

You will need `pandas` and `mercury` packages to run this example.

## Notebook

In the first cell, please import required packages:

```python
import pandas as pd
import mercury as mr
```

Let's add [`Button`](/docs/input-widgets/button/) widget:

```python
load = mr.Button(label="Load data")
```

We will define variable to keep reference to dataset:

```python
df = None
```

We will load data when button is clicked:

```python
if load.clicked:
    df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pplonski/datasets-for-start/master/adult/data.csv")
```

We display data in the last cell:

```python
df.head() if df is not None else print("Data not loaded")
```

The screenshot of the notebook's code in the Jupyter Notebook:

## Mercury App

Please start Mercury in the same directory as notebook:

```
mercury run
```

You will see the app running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Below is an animation with Mercury App.
