# Display an interactive table in Jupyter Notebook 


## Required packages

You will need to instal `mercury` and `pandas` packages to run this example.

## Notebook 

Let's import required packages:

```python
import mercury as mr
import pandas as pd
```

Please create an example DataFrame by writing following code:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "name": ["Karol", "Szymon", "Piotr", "Ola"],
        "second name": ["Falkowski", "Niewiński", "Płoński", "Płońska"],
        "age": [20, 25, 38, 36],
    }
)
```

Then, please write this code to display the table:

```python
mr.Table(df)
```

The screenshot of the notebook's code in the Jupyter Notebook:

## Mercury App 

Please start Mercury in the same directory as your notebook:

```bash
mercury run
```

You should see app running at address: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

Finall effect should look like this:
