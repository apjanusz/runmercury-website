# Stop cell execution in notebook

Sometimes you would like to stop execution of cells. 
There is a [`Stop`](/docs/output-widgets/stop/) that can be used to stop execution of cells in Jupyter Notebook from Python code.

In this example, you will learn how to use `Stop` function. We will use [`Checkbox`](/docs/input-widgets/checkbox/) widget to call `Stop` function. 
Cells below  called `Stop()` function will not be executed.

## Required packages

You will need `mercury` package to run this example.

## Notebook

In the first cell, please import required packages:

```python
import mercury as mr
```

Add `Checkbox`:

```python
should_stop = mr.Checkbox(value=False, label="Should we stop?")
```

Call `Stop()` when `Checkbox` is switched on:

```python
if should_stop.value:
    print("We stop execution here!")
    mr.Stop()
```

Let's add some code just to see the `Stop` effect:

```python
print("Some code ...")
```

The notebook's code in the Jupyter Notebook:

## Mercury App

Please start Mercury in the same directory as notebook:

```
mercury run
```

You will see the app running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Below is an animation with Mercury App:

Mercury automatically executes cells after `Checkbox` update. The `Stop()` functions stops cells execution.

Notebook from this example is available in the [mercury-examples](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-examples) repository.
