# Create widgets in the loop

It is possible to create widgets in the loop. You need to set unique `url_key` for widgets created in the loop.

## Required packages

You will need `mercury` package to run this example.

## Notebook

In the first cell, please import required packages:

```python
import mercury as mr
```

Create widgets in the loop:

```python
texts = []
for i in range(5):
    texts += [mr.Text(label=f"Widget {i}", value=f"{i}", url_key=f"w-{i}")]
```

Display widgets values:

```python
for t in texts:
    print(t.value)
```

The notebook's code in the Jupyter Notebook:

## Mercury App

Please start Mercury in the same directory as notebook:

```
mercury run
```

You will see the app running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Below is an animation with Mercury App:

Notebook from this example is available in the [mercury-examples](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-examples) repository.
