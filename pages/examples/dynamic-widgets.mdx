# Dynamic widgets

Mercury allows you to update widgets during app running. Here is an example for dynamic widgets. There are two [`Select`](/docs/input-widgets/select/) widgets. 
Choices in the second widget depend on selected values in the first one.

## Required packages

You will need to install `mercury` package to run this example.

## Notebook

Let's import required packages:

```python
import mercury as mr
```

We will define `list` and `dict` with small and capital letters:

```python
letters = ["small", "capital"]
example_letters = {
    "small": ["a", "b", "c", "d"],
    "capital": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
}
```

We will choose letter size in the first [`Select`](/docs/input-widgets/select/):

```python
size = mr.Select(value="small", choices=letters, label="Small or capital?")
```

We will choose example letter in the second [`Select`](/docs/input-widgets/select/):

```python 
example = mr.Select(value=example_letters[size.value][0], 
                    choices=example_letters[size.value], 
                    label="Select letter")
```

The last cell with print selected values:

```python 
print(f"Example {size.value} letter is {example.value}")
```

<Callout type="info">
Please remember, that widget update doesn't trigger automatic cell re-execution during notebook development in Jupyter Notebook.

Cells are automatically re-executed in Mercury.
</Callout>

## Mercury App

Please start Mercury in the same directory as notebook:

```
mercury run 
```

The Mercury Site is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Please open notebook with dynamic widgets, you can play with widgets and see the updated output:

The notebook code is available in [mercury-examples](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-examples) GitHub repository.
