# Hello World!

Let's create a simple web app that asks user for name and display greetings.

During notebook development you can interact with widget. Its value will be updated. 
However, you need to manually execute cells to see a change.

Cells are automatically re-executed when running notebook as Mercury App. 
Mercury re-execute cell with widget definition and cells below.

## Required packages

You will need `mercury` package for this example.

## Notebook

Import package:
```python
import mercury as mr
```

Create a [`Text`](/docs/input-widgets/text/) widget:
```python
name = mr.Text(value="Piotr", label="What is your name?")
```

Print widget value:
```python
print(f"Hello {name.value}")
```

<Callout type="info">
Cell 2 and 3 will be automatically re-executed after widget update when running as Mercury App.
</Callout>

Please save notebook as `hello-world.ipynb` file. Mercury will set `hello-world` as web app title.
If you want to set different title please check the [`App`](/docs/input-widgets/app/) class.

## Mercury App

Please start Mercury with the following command:

```
mercury run
```

Open web browser at address `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, you will see your notebooks. 
Please select card with your notebook. You can set name value and press `Enter` to see a change.
