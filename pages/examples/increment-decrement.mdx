# Increment and decrement app

We will create app with two buttons: `Increment` and `Decrement`. User will be able to control the value of the variable by clicking on buttons.

We will use [`Button`](/docs/input-widgets/button/) widget.

## Required packages

You will need to install `mercury` package to run this example.

## Notebook

Let's import required packages:

```python
import mercury as mr
```

Please define variable that will be updated on button click:

```python
some_value = 0
```

We will add `Increment` button:

```python 
increment = mr.Button(label="Increment", style="success")
```

There will be a `Decrement` button:

```python
decrement = mr.Button(label="Decrement", style="danger")
```

We will update the variable after buttons are clicked:

```python 
if increment.clicked:
    some_value += 1
    
if decrement.clicked:
    some_value -= 1
```

The last cell will display variable value:

```python 
print(f"Value is {some_value}")
```

The screenshot with code in the Jupyter Notebook:

<Callout type="info">
Please remember, that widget update doesn't trigger automatic cell re-execution during notebook development in Jupyter Notebook.

Cells are automatically re-executed in Mercury.
</Callout>

## Mercury App

Please start Mercury in the same directory as notebook:

```
mercury run 
```

The Mercury Site is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Please open notebook with dynamic widgets, you can play with widgets and see the updated output:

<Screenshot src={appGif} alt="Mercury App with increment and decrement" />

Button click triggers automatic cells re-execution. Cell with widget definition and below are re-executed. If button was clicked the `.clicked` attribute will be `True`. 
This attribute **will be `True` only once**! After we read it, it will be set back to `False`.

The `Download` button is to export executed result as PDF or HTML file.

The notebook code is available in [mercury-examples](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-examples) GitHub repository.
