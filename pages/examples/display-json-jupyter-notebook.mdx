# Display JSON with collapsible viewer in Jupyter Notebook

Let's use [`JSON`](/docs/output-widgets/json/) to display JSON data in collapsible viewer in Jupyter Notebook and in Mercury App.

## Required packages

You will need to install `mercury` package to run this example.

## Notebook

Let's import required packages:

```python
import mercury as mr
```

Please set [`App`](/docs/input-widgets/app/) properties:
- `title` - will be used in the sidebar,
- `static_notebook` - will serve notebook as static website.

```python
app = mr.App(title="Display notebook", static_notebook=True)
```

Create example `dict` with data:

```python
data = {
    "firstKey": ["a", "b", "c"],
    "secondKey": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "thirdKey": "Hello World!"
}
```

Display JSON data:

```python
mr.JSON(data)
```

The screenshot with code in the Jupyter Notebook:

You can control at what initial level show your JSON data by setting `level` argument:

```python
# show data at second level
mr.JSON(data, level=2)
```


<Callout type="info">
Please remember, that widget update doesn't trigger automatic cell re-execution during notebook development in Jupyter Notebook.

Cells are automatically re-executed in Mercury.

## Mercury App

Please start Mercury in the same directory as notebook:

```
mercury run 
```

The Mercury Site is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. 

Please open notebook with JSON viewer, you can interact with displayed data by clicking `+` and `-` buttons:

The notebook code is available in [mercury-examples](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-examples) GitHub repository.
