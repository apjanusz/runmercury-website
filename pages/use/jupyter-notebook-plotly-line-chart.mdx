# Plotly Line Chart

`Plotly` is a tool for creating charts, which works with Jupyter Notebook. Among its options is the **Line Chart**. We've got some examples ready to demonstrate their appearance and functionality, so you can see how they work.

- simple line chart  
- line chart with `numpy` data
- line chart with `pandas` data
- an interactive line chart 

If you need any information about **Plotly** check their docs: [**Plotly Docs**](https://plotly.com/python/).

<Callout type="info">
  After plotly installation remember to restart your Jupyter before doing anything.

All of code examples are availabe as Jupyter Notebooks in our GitHub repositiory:
- [**Plotly Line Chart**](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-integrations/blob/main/visualizations/plotly/plotly-line-chart.ipynb)
- [**Plotly Interactive Line Chart**](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-integrations/blob/main/visualizations/plotly/plotly-interactive-line-chart.ipynb)

## Line Chart 

Example using only `plotly` package:

```python 
# import packages 
import plotly.express as px 

# create data 
x = [3,20,15,3,18,10,6,18,19,3]

# plot 
fig = px.line(x)
fig.show()
```

## Line Chart with Numpy Data 

Display `numpy` data as a line chart using `plotly`:

```python 
# import packages 
import plotly.express as px 
import numpy as np 

# create data 
x = np.array([12,20,15,18,16,12,3,10,3,20])

# plot 
fig = px.line(x)
fig.show()
```

<Screenshot src={numpychartPng} alt="Plotly line chart with numpy data. " />

## Line Chart with Pandas Data 

Make a line chart with `pandas` data using `plotly`:

```python 
# import packages 
import plotly.express as px 
import pandas as pd 

# create data 
df = pd.DataFrame({'value': [10,5,15,19,7,13,13,4,2,8]})

# plot 
fig = px.line(df)
fig.show()
```

## Interactive Line Chart 

Ordinary charts are dull. Let's make an interactive line chart with `plotly` and `mercury` packages. You can choose which charts you want to display using mercury widgets. In this case, we're using [**MultiSelect**](https://runmercury.com/docs/input-widgets/multiselect/).

```python 
# import packages 
import plotly.express as px 
import mercury as mr 
import pandas as pd
```

```python 
# mercury widget 
selection = mr.MultiSelect(value=["Line1"], choices=["Line1","Line2","Line3"], label="Choose plots")
```

```python 
# create data 
x1 = [20,18,11,19,7,19,10,17,2,17]
x2 = [12,10,15,10,4,7,8,11,8,16]
x3 = [13,11,1,18,6,15,6,10,18,20]
df = pd.DataFrame()

# plot 
if "Line1" in selection.value:
    df['line1'] = x1
if "Line2" in selection.value:
    df['line2'] = x2
if "Line3" in selection.value:
    df['line3'] = x3
fig = px.line(df)
fig.show()
```

Now, you can easily turn your Jupyter Notebook into a Web App! Check out this video to see how it looks.

  <source

    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

Deploying Web App is very easy that you can do it in 3 steps:

<div className="steps-container">

### Login to Mercury Cloud

If you don't have account, you can create it here: [**Mercury Cloud**](https://cloud.runmercury.com/register).

### Create new site

Create new or use an existing site. 

### Upload your notebook

Upload the notebook with code.

**Congrats!** You just created your own Web App and you can share your Jupyter Notebooks with nontechnical users. If you need more information about deploying the Web App check [**Mercury Cloud Documentation**](https://runmercury.com/docs/cloud/).
