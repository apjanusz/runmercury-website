# Seaborn Scatter Chart

## Introduction

`Seaborn` is a tool used for creating visual charts, specifically designed to work smoothly with Jupyter Notebook. Among its offerings is the **Scatter Chart**, a commonly used visualization method. We've prepared some examples to illustrate how they appear and function for your reference.
- simple scatter chart  
- scatter chart with `numpy` data
- scatter chart with `pandas` data
- an interactive scatter chart 

If you need any information about **Seaborn** check their docs: [**Seaborn Docs**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html).

All of code examples are availabe as Jupyter Notebooks in our GitHub repositiory:
- [**Seaborn Scatter Chart**](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-integrations/blob/main/visualizations/seaborn/seaborn-scatter-chart.ipynb)
- [**Seaborn Interactive Scatter Chart**](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-integrations/blob/main/visualizations/seaborn/seaborn-interactive-scatter-chart.ipynb)

# Scatter Chart 

Example with just `seaborn`:

```python
# import packages 
import seaborn as sns

# create data 
x = [3, 9, 9, 7, 2, 10, 9, 6, 6, 10]

# plot 
_ = sns.scatterplot(x)
```

## Scatter Chart with Numpy Data 

Show `numpy` data as scatter chart using `seaborn`:

```python 
# import packages 
import seaborn as sns 
import numpy as np 

# create data 
x = np.array([3, 9, 7, 4, 3, 1, 10, 7, 10, 6])

# plot 
_ = sns.scatterplot(x)
```

## Scatter Chart with Pandas Data 

Create a scatter chart using `seaborn` with `pandas` data:

```python 
# import packages 
import seaborn as sns 
import pandas as pd 

# create data 
df = pd.DataFrame({ 'value': [4, 3, 6, 4, 1, 5, 10, 2, 1, 3]})

# plot 
_ = sns.scatterplot(df)
```

## Interactive Scatter Chart 

Static charts are boring. Let's create an interactive scatter chart using `seaborn` and `mercury` packages. You can modify data range conveniently with mercury widgets. In this example we used [**Slider**](https://runmercury.com/docs/input-widgets/slider/).

```python
# import packages 
import seaborn as sns 
import mercury as mr
```

```python 
# mercury widget
slider = mr.Slider(value=10, min=8, max=20, label="How many dots?")
```

```python
# create data
all_x = [22, 6, 17, 13, 10, 3, 17, 21, 22, 22, 9, 11, 10, 12, 16, 16, 4, 6, 14, 9]
x = all_x[0:slider.value]

# plot 
_ = sns.scatterplot(x)
```

Now, you can transform your Jupyter Notebook into a Web App effortlessly! Watch this video to see how it look.

Deploying Web App is very easy that you can do it in 3 steps:

<div className="steps-container">

### Login to Mercury Cloud

If you don't have account, you can create it here: [**Mercury Cloud**](https://cloud.runmercury.com/register).

### Create new site

Create new or use an existing site. 

### Upload your notebook

Upload the notebook with code.
