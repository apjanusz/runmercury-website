# Seaborn Line Chart 

## Introduction

`Seaborn` is a tool used for creating visual charts, specifically designed to work smoothly with Jupyter Notebook. Among its offerings is the **Line Chart**, a commonly used visualization method. We've prepared some examples to illustrate how they appear and function for your reference.
- simple line chart  
- line chart with `numpy` data
- line chart with `pandas` data
- an interactive line chart 

If you need any information about **Seaborn** check their docs: [**Seaborn Docs**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html).

All of code examples are availabe as Jupyter Notebooks in our GitHub repositiory:
- [**Seaborn Line Chart**](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-integrations/blob/main/visualizations/seaborn/seaborn-line-chart.ipynb)
- [**Seaborn Interactive Line Chart**](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-integrations/blob/main/visualizations/seaborn/seaborn-interactive-line-chart.ipynb)

## Line Chart 

Example with just `seaborn`:

```python 
# import packages
import seaborn as sns 

# create data 
x = [4, 10, 15, 8, 13, 11, 19, 9, 14, 20]

# plot 
_ = sns.lineplot(x)
```

## Line Chart with Numpy Data 

Show `numpy` data as line chart using `seaborn`:

```python 
# import packages 
import seaborn as sns 
import numpy as np 

# create data 
x = np.array([18, 11, 10, 16, 15, 20, 9, 15, 15, 3])

# plot 
_ = sns.lineplot(x)
```

## Line Chart with Pandas Data 

Create a line chart using `seaborn` with `pandas` data:

```python
# import packages 
import seaborn as sns 
import pandas as pd 

# create data
df = pd.DataFrame({'value': [15, 11, 13, 9, 4, 9, 17, 7, 5, 8]})

# plot 
_ = sns.lineplot(df)
```

## Interactive Line Chart

Static charts are boring. Let's create an interactive line chart using `seaborn` and `mercury` packages. You can choose which data you want to display with mercury widgets. In this example we used [**Select**](https://runmercury.com/docs/input-widgets/select/).

```python 
# import packages 
import seaborn as sns 
import mercury as mr 
```

```python 
# mercury widget 
selection = mr.Select(label="Choose Data:", value="Plot 1", choices=["Plot 1", "Plot 2", "Plot 3"])
```

```python 
# create data 
x1 = [4, 10, 15, 8, 13, 11, 19, 9, 14, 20]
x2 = [18, 11, 10, 16, 15, 20, 9, 15, 15, 3]
x3 = [15, 11, 13, 9, 4, 9, 17, 7, 5, 8]

# plot 
if "Plot 1" in selection.value: 
    _ = sns.lineplot(x1)
elif "Plot 2" in selection.value:
    _ = sns.lineplot(x2)
elif "Plot 3" in selection.value:
    _ = sns.lineplot(x3)
```

Now, you can transform your Jupyter Notebook into a Web App effortlessly! Watch this video to see how it looks.
