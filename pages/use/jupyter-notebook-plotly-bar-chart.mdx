# Plotly Bar Chart

`Plotly` is a tool for creating charts, which works with Jupyter Notebook. Among its options is the **Bar Chart**. We've got some examples ready to demonstrate their appearance and functionality, so you can see how they work.

- simple bar chart  
- bar chart with `numpy` data
- bar chart with `pandas` data
- an interactive bar chart 

If you need any information about **Plotly** check their docs: [**Plotly Docs**](https://plotly.com/python/).

<Callout type="info">
  After plotly installation remember to restart your Jupyter before doing anything.

All of code examples are availabe as Jupyter Notebooks in our GitHub repositiory:
- [**Plotly Bar Chart**](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-integrations/blob/main/visualizations/plotly/plotly-bar-chart.ipynb)
- [**Plotly Interactive Bar Chart**](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-integrations/blob/main/visualizations/plotly/plotly-interactive-bar-chart.ipynb)

## Bar Chart 

Example using only `plotly` package:

```python 
# import packages 
import plotly.express as px

# create data 
x = [3, 13, 1, 12, 19, 7, 16, 13, 10, 1]

# plot 
fig = px.bar(x)
fig.show()
```

## Bar Chart with Numpy Data

Display `numpy` data as a bar chart using `plotly`:

```python
# import packages
import plotly.express as px
import numpy as np 

# create data 
x = np.array([20, 14, 9, 11, 19, 7, 5, 17, 16, 20])

# plot 
fig = px.bar(x)
fig.show()
```

## Bar Chart with Pandas Data 

Make a bar chart with `pandas` data using `plotly`:

```python 
# import packages 
import plotly.express as px 
import pandas as pd 

# create data 
df = pd.DataFrame({'value': [18, 13, 12, 2, 20, 12, 5, 4, 16, 17]})

# plot 
fig = px.bar(df)
fig.show()
```

## Interactive Bar Chart

Ordinary charts are dull. Let's make an interactive bar chart with `plotly` and `mercury` packages. You can choose which data you want to display using mercury widgets. In this case, we're using [**Select**](https://runmercury.com/docs/input-widgets/select/).

```python 
# import packages 
import plotly.express as px
import mercury as mr
```

```python 
# mercury widget 
select = mr.Select(value="growing", choices=["growing","decreasing","random"], label="Choose data:")
```

```python 
# create data 
grow = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
decr = [12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
rand = [9,20,18,13,5,11,8,5,11,1,11,13]

# plot 
if select.value == "growing":
    fig = px.bar(grow)
elif select.value == "decreasing":
    fig = px.bar(decr)
elif select.value == "random":
    fig = px.bar(rand)
fig.show()
```

Now, you can easily turn your Jupyter Notebook into a Web App! Check out this video to see how it looks.

  />
</video>

Deploying Web App is very easy that you can do it in 3 steps:

<div className="steps-container">

### Login to Mercury Cloud

If you don't have account, you can create it here: [**Mercury Cloud**](https://cloud.runmercury.com/register).

### Create new site

Create new or use an existing site. 

### Upload your notebook

Upload the notebook with code.

**Congrats!** You just created your own Web App and you can share your Jupyter Notebooks with nontechnical users. If you need more information about deploying the Web App check [**Mercury Cloud Documentation**](https://runmercury.com/docs/cloud/).
