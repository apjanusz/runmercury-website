# Plotly Scatter Chart 



`Plotly` is a tool for creating charts, which works with Jupyter Notebook. Among its options is the **Scatter Chart**. We've got some examples ready to demonstrate their appearance and functionality, so you can see how they work.

- simple scatter chart  
- scatter chart with `numpy` data
- scatter chart with `pandas` data
- an interactive scatter chart 

If you need any information about **Plotly** check their docs: [**Plotly Docs**](https://plotly.com/python/).

<Callout type="info">
  After plotly installation remember to restart your Jupyter before doing anything.

All of code examples are availabe as Jupyter Notebooks in our GitHub repositiory:
- [**Plotly Scatter Chart**](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-integrations/blob/main/visualizations/plotly/plotly-scatter-chart.ipynb)
- [**Plotly Interactive Scatter Chart**](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-integrations/blob/main/visualizations/plotly/plotly-interactive-scatter-chart.ipynb)

## Scatter Chart 

Example using only `plotly` package:

```python 
# import packages 
import plotly.express as px 

# create data 
x = [2,4,6,1,5]
y = [8,5,7,4,6]

# plot 
fig = px.scatter(x,y)
fig.show()
```

## Scatter Chart with Numpy Data 

Display `numpy` data as a scatter chart using `plotly`:

```python
# import package 
import plotly.express as px
import numpy as np 

# create data 
x = np.array([7,5,8,4,3,4])
y = np.array([4,6,4,7,5,1])

# plot 
fig = px.scatter(x,y)
fig.show()
```

## Scatter Chart with Pandas Data 

Make a scatter chart with `pandas` data using `plotly`:

```python 
# import packages 
import plotly.express as px 
import pandas as pd 

# create data 
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': [5,7,8,4,6,2]})

# plot 
fig = px.scatter(df)
fig.show()
```

## Interactive Scatter Chart 

Ordinary charts are dull. Let's make an interactive scatter chart with `plotly` and `mercury` packages. You can modify data range using mercury widgets. In this case, we're using [**Range**](https://runmercury.com/docs/input-widgets/range/).

```python
# import packages 
import plotly.express as px 
import mercury as mr 
```

```python
# mercury widget
range = mr.Range(value=[1,6], min=0, max=10, label="Set data range")
```

```python
# create data 
all_x = [7,5,4,8,2,12,5,7,9,11,6]
x = all_x[range.value[0]:range.value[1]+1]

# plot 
fig = px.scatter(x)
fig.show()
```

Now, you can easily turn your Jupyter Notebook into a Web App! Check out this video to see how it looks.

    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

Deploying Web App is very easy that you can do it in 3 steps:

<div className="steps-container">

### Login to Mercury Cloud

If you don't have account, you can create it here: [**Mercury Cloud**](https://cloud.runmercury.com/register).

### Create new site

Create new or use an existing site. 

### Upload your notebook

Upload the notebook with code.

**Congrats!** You just created your own Web App and you can share your Jupyter Notebooks with nontechnical users. If you need more information about deploying the Web App check [**Mercury Cloud Documentation**](https://runmercury.com/docs/cloud/).
