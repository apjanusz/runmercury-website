# Plotly Histogram Chart

`Plotly` is a tool for creating charts, which works with Jupyter Notebook. Among its options is the **Histogram Chart**. We've got some examples ready to demonstrate their appearance and functionality, so you can see how they work.

- simple histogram chart  
- histogram chart with `numpy` data
- histogram chart with `pandas` data
- an interactive histogram chart 

If you need any information about **Plotly** check their docs: [**Plotly Docs**](https://plotly.com/python/).

<Callout type="info">
  After plotly installation remember to restart your Jupyter before doing anything.

All of code examples are availabe as Jupyter Notebooks in our GitHub repositiory:
- [**Plotly Histogram Chart**](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-integrations/blob/main/visualizations/plotly/plotly-histogram-chart.ipynb)
- [**Plotly Interactive Histogram Chart**](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-integrations/blob/main/visualizations/plotly/plotly-interactive-histogram-chart.ipynb)

# Histogram Chart 

Example using only `plotly` package:

```python 
# import packages
import plotly.express as px

# create data 
x = [9,38,12,36,31,7,41,18,28,33,27,44,37,43,19,55,59,61]

# plot 
fig = px.histogram(x)
fig.show()
```

## Histogram Chart with Numpy Data 

Display `numpy` data as a histogram chart using `plotly`:

```python 
# import packages 
import plotly.express as px 
import numpy as np 

# create data 
x = np.array([21, 22, 1, 42, 13, 4, 17, 26, 5, 19, 16, 39, 3, 24, 35, 18, 10, 36])

# plot 
fig = px.histogram(x)
fig.show()
```

## Histogram Chart with Pandas Data 

Make a histogram chart with `pandas` data using `plotly`:

```python 
# import packages 
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd 

# create data 
df = pd.DataFrame({'value': [35,17,39,44,24,2,11,14,45,6,11,48,22,18,42,39,18,12]})

# plot 
fig = px.histogram(df)
fig.show()
```

## Interactive Histogram Chart 

Ordinary charts are dull. Let's make an interactive histogram chart with `plotly` and `mercury` packages. You can modify gaps between bars using mercury widgets. In this case, we're using [**Slider**](https://runmercury.com/docs/input-widgets/slider/).

```python
# import packages 
import plotly.express as px 
import mercury as mr 
```

```python 
# mercury widget 
slider = mr.Slider(value=0.0, min=0.0, max=0.6, step=0.1, label="Set bar gaps")
```

```python
# create data 
x = [9,38,12,36,31,7,41,18,28,33,27,44,37,43,19,55,59,61]

# plot 
fig = px.histogram(x)
fig.update_layout(bargap=slider.value)
fig.show()
```

Now, you can easily turn your Jupyter Notebook into a Web App! Check out this video to see how it looks.

    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

Deploying Web App is very easy that you can do it in 3 steps:

<div className="steps-container">

### Login to Mercury Cloud

If you don't have account, you can create it here: [**Mercury Cloud**](https://cloud.runmercury.com/register).

### Create new site

Create new or use an existing site. 

### Upload your notebook

Upload the notebook with code.

**Congrats!** You just created your own Web App and you can share your Jupyter Notebooks with nontechnical users. If you need more information about deploying the Web App check [**Mercury Cloud Documentation**](https://runmercury.com/docs/cloud/).
