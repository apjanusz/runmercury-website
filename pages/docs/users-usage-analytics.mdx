# Users Analytics

Thanks to **Users Analytics** you can check how many logged and unlogged users display your Notebooks!

## Users Count

As you can see there is the beautiful **Chart** which shows how many unlogged and logged users saw your Notebooks. 

You can choose which Notebooks will be displayed by clicking their names which are placed above the chart:

You can also download it by clicking the hamburger located in the top-right corner:

If users which saw your Notebooks have accounts on **Mercury Cloud** you will see information about them in this table.
