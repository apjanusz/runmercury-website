# Am I In Mercury?

There is a function `in_mercury()` that returns `True` when executed in the notebook which is served as web app in Mercury Server. It returns `False` when executed during the development of the notebook (in Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, VS Code, Google Colab, ...).

## Example code 

```python
import mercury as mr

if mr.in_mercury():
    print("Web App")
else:
    print("Notebook")
```
