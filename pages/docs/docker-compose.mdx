# Deploy with docker-compose

In this section, we will show you steps needed to deploy Mercury Server with `docker-compose` on VPS machine. 

There are two configuration files available for `docker-compose`:
- simple deployment with HTTP (port 80) ([`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/mljar/mercury/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)),
- more advanced deployment with HTTP and HTTPS (port 443) ([`docker-compose-https.yml`](https://github.com/mljar/mercury/blob/main/docker-compose-https.yml)). 

Both deployments are using `Nginx` as a proxy, and the `PostreSQL` as a database. The `Let's Encrypt` service with `certbot` is used for HTTPS deployment. 

It is a good practice to start with simpler deployment that is using HTTP only. If it will be working OK. Then we can use HTTPS deployment.

## Install `docker` and `docker-compose`

You can skip this step if you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.

I'm using Ubuntu as operating system. Below steps to install `docker`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo docker --version
```

If the last command displays the `docker` version, it is installed correctly.

The next step is to install the `docker-compose`:

```bash
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo docker-compose version
```

You are ready to start if you get the `docker-compose` version in the last command.

## Copy notebooks to server

The first step is to copy notebooks to the server. Good approach is to keep notebook in a GitHub repository and just clone it to the server.

I've created a simple repository with two notebooks. It is available in the GitHub at [mljar/mercury-deploy-demo](https://github.com/mljar/mercury-deploy-demo).

Please notice that we have in the repository:
- `requirements.txt` file with list of needed Python pacakges,
- `welcome.md` file with custom welcome message.

Please clone the repository to server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mljar/mercury-deploy-demo.git
```

## Clone Mercury repository

We will copy Mercury repository and use it to build `docker` containters.

Please clone Mercury repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mljar/mercury.git
```

Please change the working directory:

```bash
cd mercury
```

## Environment variables

Before starting containers, please create the `.env` file with configuration variables.

Below is an example `.env` file:

```bash
NOTEBOOKS_PATH=../mercury-deploy-demo/
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=piotr
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=verysecretpass
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=piotr@example.com
ALLOWED_HOSTS=mercury.mljar.com
SECRET_KEY="x3%q8fs(-q3i(m&=e1g%9xtvcn*q!c%i@v0*ha4@ow2crdkaaa"
DEBUG=False
SERVE_STATIC=False
WELCOME=/app/notebooks/welcome.md
TIME_ZONE=Europe/Warsaw
DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
MERCURY_VERBOSE=0
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=none
```

The most important variables
- **`NOTEBOOKS_PATH`** - a path to directory with your notebooks. This variable is required. It can be a relative path.
- **`ALLOWED_HOSTS`** - coma separated list of allowed hosts (domains or IP addresses). This variable is required.
- if you need access to Admin Panel please define: `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME`, `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`, `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL`.


## Build containers with HTTP support only

Build containers with `docker-compose.yml` configuration:

```
sudo docker-compose build
```

Please start `docker-compose`:

```
sudo docker-compose up
```

You should be able to see a Mercury Server running in the web browser at your IP address. 

Please make sure that you are using **HTTP** protocol, your address should be `http://ip-address` or `http://your-domain.com`.


<Screenshot src={deployHttpPng} alt="Deployment with HTTP support" />

Please notice that you will have information about `not secure` connection near the URL address.


## DNS settings

Please create **A** records in the DNS table pointing your domain name to your server IP address.

If you are going to use HTTPS support please create two **A** records:
- first record pointing your domain (for example `mercury.mljar.com`) to server IP,
- second record pointing your domain with `www` (for example `www.mercury.mljar.com`) to server IP.

Both records are required when setting up certificates with `Let's Encrypt`.

## Build containers with HTTPS support

After setting DNS records, please run `setup-https.sh` script from Mercury repository with your domain name:

```bash
sudo ./setup-https.sh your-domain-name.com
```

Example:
```bash
sudo ./setup-https.sh mercury.mljar.com
```

Please run the above command in the server machine. 
The above command will issue certificates from `Let's Encrypt` and set files for HTTP challenge to pass verification.

You can also provide your own certificates. Please take a look at `docker/nginx/pro` for configuration.

<Screenshot src={deployHttpsPng} alt="Deployment with HTTPS support" />

Please notice that you will have information about `secure` connection near the URL address - there should be lock displayed.


## Start and stop containers

If you are using containers with HTTP only support:

```bash
# stop containers
sudo docker-compose stop 

# start containers
sudo docker-compose up

# start containers in detached model
sudo docker-compose up -d 
```

If you are using HTTPS support:

```bash
# stop containers
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-https.yml stop 

# start containers
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-https.yml up

# start containers in detached model
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-https.yml up -d 
```

## Renew certificates

Certificates from `Let's Encrypt` are issued for 90 days. They are automatically renewed by `certbot` container. 

## Deploy on subpath

It is possible to deploy Mercury on subpath, for example: `mydomain.com/subpath`. It can be achived after few changes in the code, described below.


<div className="steps-container">

### Update nginx configuration

Comment out code in the `docker/nginx/default.conf:

```
    # location / {
    #     root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    #     index  index.html index.htm;
    #     try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    # }
```

Add code:

```
    location = /subpath {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        try_files /index.html =404;
    }

    location ~ ^/subpath(.*) {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        try_files $1 $1/ /index.html =404;
    }
```

### Update `package.json`

We need to add `homepage` in the `frontend/package.json`:

```
{
  "name": "frontend",
  "homepage":"/subpath", 
   # ... rest of json ...
```

### Update `Routes.tsx`

Update `Router` with `basename` argument in the `frontend/src/Routes.tsx`:

```
   // rest of code ...
    <Router basename="/subpath">
   // rest of code ...
```

### Build docker

Please rebuild the docker after those changes.
