# Deploy with docker-compose

You can deploy Mercury Server with `docker-compose` on any VPS machine. In this section, we will show you steps needed to deploy Mercury Server with `docker-compose`. 
There are two configuration files available:
- simple deployment with HTTP (port 80),
- more advanced deployment with HTTP and HTTPS (port 443). 

Both deployments are using `Nginx` as a proxy, and the `PostreSQL` as a database. `Let's Encrypt` service with `certbot` is used for HTTPS deployment. 

## Create notebooks 

The first step is to create notebooks. Please create them in a separate directory or (ideally) in separate GitHub repository. 
Please make sure that required packages are listed in `requirements.txt` file.

## Clone Mercury repository

Please clone Mercury repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:mljar/mercury.git
```

Change the directory and build `docker-compose` containers:

```
cd mercury

sudo docker-compose build
```

Before starting container, please create the `.env` file with configuration variables:

- `NOTEBOOKS_PATH` - a path to directory with your notebooks. This variable is required.
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` - coma separated list of allowed hosts (domains or IP addresses). This variable is required.
- if you need access to Admin Panel please define: `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME`, `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`, `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL`.

Example `.env` file:

```
NOTEBOOKS_PATH=./mercury/
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=piotr
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=verysecretpass
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=piotr@piotr.pl
ALLOWED_HOSTS=mercury.mljar.com
SECRET_KEY="x3%q8fs(-q3i(m&=e1g%9xtvcn*q!c%i@v0*ha4@ow2crdkaaa"
DEBUG=False
SERVE_STATIC=False
WELCOME=./mercury/welcome.md
TIME_ZONE=Europe/Warsaw
DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
MERCURY_VERBOSE=0
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=none
```

Please start `docker-compose`:

```
sudo docker-compose up
```

You should be able to see a Mercury Server running in the web browser at address `http://0.0.0.0`.

## HTTPS support

You can enable HTTPS for Mercury Server. You will need a custom domain for this. Please set `A` record in DNS table pointing your server IP address to domain name.

After setting DNS records, please run `setup-https.sh` script from Mercury repository with your domain name:

```
sudo ./setup-https.sh your-domain-name.com
```

Please run the above command in the server machine. The above command will issue certificates from `Let's Encrypt` and set files for HTTP challenge to pass verification.

You can also provide your own certificates. Please take a look at `docker/nginx/pro` for configuration.

## Help needed

If you need help with deployment please setup a new issue in the [Mercury repository](https://github.com/mljar/mercury) or [email us](/support/contact/). We are happy to help!
