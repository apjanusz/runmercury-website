# Deploy Jupyter Notebooks at Hugging Face Spaces with Mercury

One of possible options for Mercury deployments is the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) Spaces.

What are pros:
- they have free machines with 2 vCPU and 16 GB,
- in paid plan they offer different size of machines also with GPU.

What are cons:
- you can't use Mercury authantication, in HF deployment the SQLite database is used, that's why after machine restart you will have clean database (you lost all your users). 
- your apps will be hosted at `hf.space` domain, you can't setup custom domain.

If you want to try this option, please create an account at [https://huggingface.co/](https://huggingface.co/) and let's start.

### Create a new Space

Please create a new Space. The Space name will be used to create URL address for your application, so it is good to have some meaningful name.

For Space SDK please select **Gradio**. Why Gradio? Because Gradio SDK is in fact Python environment which can be used to run any Python application.

By the way, the [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) is a framework for show-casing Machine Learning models (the Gradio was acquired by HuggingFace company). 
It is a good choice for making a simple web app that takes input values, runs Machine Learning model and presents computed output. It is not a good choice for general Data Science things (dashboards, visualizations, reports).

## Add `app.py` file 

Please select `Files` in the top menu. And click `Add file`->`Create a new file` in the empty Space.

<Screenshot src={emptySpacePng} alt="Empty Space at Hugging Face" />

Please add `app.py` file with below code and click `Commit new file to main` (should be at the bottom):

```python
import os
from subprocess import Popen

command = ["mercury", "run", f"0.0.0.0:{os.environ.get('PORT', 7860)}"] 
worker = Popen(command) 
worker.wait()
```

<Screenshot src={appFilePng} alt="App.py file in Space at Hugging Face" />

The `app.py` is a file that starts the Mercury in this Space. The `7860` is a default port that is open in the HF Spaces.

## Add `requirements.txt` file

We need to add `requirements.txt` with required Python packages. Please click `Add file`->`Create a new file`.

```
mercury>=2.2.6
```

<Screenshot src={requirementsFilePng} alt="requirements.txt file in Space at Hugging Face" />

You can add here more packages - depends what you will need in you notebooks (for example `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`).

Please add a new file by clicking `Commit new file to main`. 

## Upload notebooks

The last step is to upload your notebooks. In the `Files` view, please click `Add file`->`Upload files`.

<Screenshot src={uploadNotebooksPng} alt="Upload Notebooks in Space at Hugging Face" />

After notebooks upload, please remember to click `Commit changes to main`.

## App

The last step is to refresh the website and open the `App` view.

You can right click on Mercury logo and open app in the new tab. You will see that your app is hosted at domain:

```
https://username-app-name.hf.space/
```

In my case it is:
```
https://pplonski-my-notebooks.hf.space/
```

You can play with my notebooks at [https://pplonski-my-notebooks.hf.space/](https://pplonski-my-notebooks.hf.space/).
