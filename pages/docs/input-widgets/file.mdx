# File

The `File` class allows to upload and read files in the notebook.

Files can be accessed as binary objects or by reading them from file path (they are temporary stored for reading).

```python
import mercury as mr

# add file upload widget
my_file = mr.File(label="File upload", max_file_size="100MB")

# get file path in the code and read its content
print(f"Let's read content of {my_file.filepath}")
with open(my_file.filepath, "r") as fin:
    print(fin.read())

# get file name
print(f"Thanks for uploading {my_file.filename}")

# get file content in binary format
binary_content = my_file.value
```

## Parameters

- **label** (_string_) - label of the file upload widget.
- **max_file_size** (_string_) - the maximum size of allowed file upload, default is set to "100MB". 
- **disabled** (_boolean_) - disable widget in the sidebar, default is set to `False`.
