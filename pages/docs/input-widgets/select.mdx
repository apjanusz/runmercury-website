# Select

Make your Notebook look better! You can add select widgets with option to select a single value, all of this with **Select** *(Mercury Widget)*.



## 1. How to use Select

**Example code:**

```python
import mercury as mr
```
```python
my_selection = mr.Select(value = "a", choices = ["a", "b", "c"], label = "Select option")
```
```python
print(f"Selected value is: {my_selection.value}.")
```

**Code explain:**

Fist step is importing Mercury. Then create variable *(my_selection in our case)* and asign the `Select` widget to it. There are 3 parameters: 

- **value** *(string)* is a default selection. If value is not present in choices or if value is empty, it sets value to the first element of choices. 
- **choices** *(list of strings)* is a place where you can set options which user chooses later. It can't be empty!
- **label** *(string)* is a title of selection widget. 

At the end print your results using `my_selection.value`.

## 2. Example of use

People often use `Select` with `if` construction:

**First option selected:**
<Screenshot src={firstoptionPng} alt="Code with first option selected" />
**Second option selected:**
<Screenshot src={secondoptionPng} alt="Code with second option selected" />

*Code to copy:*
```python
import mercury as mr
```
```python
selection = mr.Select(value = "greeting", choices = ["greeting", "farewell"], label = "Select option")
```
```python
if selection.value == "greeting":
    print("Hello!")
elif selection.value == "farewell":
    print("See you later!")
```
