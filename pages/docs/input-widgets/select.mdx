# Select

Make your Notebook look better! You can add `Select` widgets with option to select a single value, all of this with `Select` *(Mercury Widget)*.

**Example code:**

```python
import mercury as mr
```
```python
my_selection = mr.Select(value = "a", choices = ["a", "b", "c"], label = "Select option")
```
```python
print(f"Selected value is: {my_selection.value}.")
```

**Code explanation:**

Fist step is importing Mercury. Then create variable *(my_selection in our case)* and asign the `Select` widget to it. At the end print your results using `my_selection.value`.

## Parameters

- **value** (_string_) is a default selection. If value is not present in choices or if value is empty, it sets value to the first element of choices. 
- **choices** (_list of strings_) is a place where you can set options which user chooses later. It can't be empty!
- **label** (_string_) is a title of selection widget. 
- **url_key** (_string_) - set this value if you would like to set `Select` value with URL paramters.
- **disabled** (_boolean_) - disable widget in the sidebar, default is set to `False`.
- **hidden** (_boolean_) - hide widget in the sidebar, default is set to `False`.

## Example of use

People often use `Select` with `if` construction:

**First option selected:**
<Screenshot src={firstoptionPng} alt="Code with first option selected" />
**Second option selected:**
<Screenshot src={secondoptionPng} alt="Code with second option selected" />

*Code to copy:*
```python
import mercury as mr
```
```python
selection = mr.Select(value = "greeting", choices = ["greeting", "farewell"], label = "Select option")
```
```python
if selection.value == "greeting":
    print("Hello!")
elif selection.value == "farewell":
    print("See you later!")
```
