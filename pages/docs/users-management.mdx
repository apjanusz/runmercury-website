# Users Management

## View access

If your site has public status, all of users has access to view it. The situation is different when site has private status, then you have to add specific user and give him VIEW permission.

## Edit access

Independently from your site status, nobody has access to edit it until you give them permission. 

## Give permissions

<Callout type="info">
After you invite users to your site, they got an email with invitation. If they don't have account on Mercury Cloud, they can sign up and then they got access which you gave them.
</Callout>
