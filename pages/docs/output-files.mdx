# Output files 

You can make files created in the notebook available for download with [`OutputDir`](/docs/output-widgets/outputdir). 
All files saved in this directory will be available for download.

There will be `App` and `Output Files` buttons in the sidebar to switch between App and files views. Please check the animation below.


import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout type="info">
  `App` and `Output Files` buttons will appear in the sidebar only if you use the `OutputDir` class in your notebook. 
</Callout>

## Example code 

```python
import os
import mercury as mr

my_folder = mr.OutputDir()

# you can print the directory path
# it will be current directory when running in the Jupyter Notebook
# it will be some temporary directory path when running in Mercury
print(f"Output directory path: {my_folder.path}")


# save example text file in OutputDir
first_file_name = os.path.join(my_folder.path, "example-file.txt")
with open(first_file_name, "w") as fout:
    fout.write("Hello there!")


# save one more text file in OutputDir
second_file_name = os.path.join(my_folder.path, "one-more-file.txt")
with open(second_file_name, "w") as fout:
    fout.write("Saving files in OutputDir")
```
