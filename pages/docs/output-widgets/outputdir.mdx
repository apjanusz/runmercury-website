# OutputDir

Output directory when you can save files for download. All files that are saved in the `OutputDir` are available for download for users.

```python
import mercury as mr

# get output directory widget
my_dir = mr.OutputDir()

# print output directory path
print(f"All files will be saved to {my_dir.path}")

# save example file
import os
with open(os.path.join([my_dir.path, "example-file.txt"]), "w") as fout:
    fout.write("Hello!")

# the file `example-file.txt` will be available for download in the Mercury app.
```

The `OutputDir` creates temporary directory where files are saved.

You can't save directories in the `OutputDir`, only files.

<Callout type="warning">
There should be only one instance of `OutputDir` in the notebook.

If you will create several instances of `OutputDir` they will point to the same path.
