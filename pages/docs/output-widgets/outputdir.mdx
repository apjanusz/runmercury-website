# OutputDir

Output directory when you can save files for download. All files that are saved in the `OutputDir` are available for download for users.

```python
import os
import mercury as mr
```
```python
# get output directory widget
# all files saved in the OutputDir will be available for download in Mercury
my_dir = mr.OutputDir()
```
```python
# print output directory path
print(f"All files will be saved to {my_dir.path}")

# save example file
with open(os.path.join(my_dir.path, "example-file.txt"), "w") as fout:
    fout.write("Hello Mercury!")

# the file `example-file.txt` will be available for download in the Mercury app.
```

The `OutputDir` creates temporary directory where files are saved.

You can't save directories in the `OutputDir`, only files.

<Callout type="info">
There should be only one instance of `OutputDir` in the notebook.

If you will create several instances of `OutputDir` they will point to the same path.
