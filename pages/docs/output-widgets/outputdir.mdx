# OutputDir

Use `OutputDir` when you would like to save files for download. 

```python
import os
import mercury as mr
```
```python
# get output directory widget
# all files saved in the OutputDir will be available for download in Mercury
my_dir = mr.OutputDir()
```
```python
# print output directory path
print(f"All files will be saved to {my_dir.path}")

# save example file
with open(os.path.join(my_dir.path, "example-file.txt"), "w") as fout:
    fout.write("Hello Mercury!")

# the file `example-file.txt` will be available for download in the Mercury app.
```

When running notebook as web app, there will be an additional view `Output Files`. It will list all files saved in the `OutputDir`.

The `OutputDir` creates temporary directory where files are saved. 
You can't save directories in the `OutputDir`, only files.

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout type="info">
There should be only one instance of `OutputDir` in the notebook.

If you will create several instances of `OutputDir` they will point to the same path.
</Callout>

## Example App

Here is a simple Python notebook that creates two text files in the `OutputDir`. (You can save files in the any format in the `OutputDir`.)
