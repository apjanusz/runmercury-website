# PDF 

You can add and display PDF in your notebook  using `PDF` *(Mercury Widget)*.

**Example code:**

```python
import mercury as mr
```
```python
mr.PDF(file_path="example.pdf", width="100%", height=800)
```

**Code explanation:**

First step is importing Mercury package. Then choose PDF which you want to display and create code using `PDF` widget.

## Parameters

- `file_path` *(string)* is name of PDF which you want to display. It's important to have the PDF and the notebook in the same directory.
- `width` *(value)* sets width of PDF. You don't have to type it every time, default value is **100%**.
- `height` *(value)* sets height of PDF. This parameter is also unnecessary, default value is **800**.
