# APIResponse

You can execute notebook with REST API call and return JSON response from notebook. The `APIResponse` object is use to return JSON. It will be returned as REST API response. What is more, the JSON will be displayed in the notebook.

```python
import mercury as mr
```
```python
# return JSON response
response = mr.APIResponse({"message": "Hello from Mercury!", 
                           "description": "You can execute notebook with REST API return JSON as response"})
```

In the notebook the `APIResponse` is displayed as JSON:

<Screenshot src={notebookPng} alt="Return JSON response from Jupyter Notebook executed with REST API" />

You can serve notebook as REST API endpoint with Mercury. In this case, the `APIResponse` will define JSON response from enpoint.
