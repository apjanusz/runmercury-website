# Stop

It stops execution of cells. When function `Stop` is called then cells below are not executed. It can be used as function `Stop` or you can raise exception `StopException`.

```python
import mercury as mr

# cells below are not executed
mr.Stop()

# or you can raise exception
raise mr.StopException()
```

The `Stop` function and `StopException` don't leave traceback in the notebook. The exception stops cells execution.
