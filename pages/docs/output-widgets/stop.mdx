# Stop

It stops execution of cells. When function `Stop()` is called then cells below are not executed. 
It can be used as function `Stop` or you can raise exception `StopExecution`.

import mercury as mr

# cells below are not executed
mr.Stop()

# or you can raise exception
raise mr.StopExecution()
```

The `Stop` function and `StopExecution` exception don't leave traceback in the notebook.
