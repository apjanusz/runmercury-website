# Install your packages

**Mercury Cloud** is using separate container for each notebook, which comes with `Python 3.9` and the following libraries preinstalled:

`mercury` `mljar-supervised` `numpy` `pandas` `matplotlib` `seaborn` `altair` `vega_datasets` `plotly` `scikit-learn`

## Install public packages

You can also use other libraries in your notebook. You have to create a `requirements.txt` file with libraries names:
```
package_name1
package_name2
```
You can include versions of libraries: 
```
package_name1==version1
package_name2>=version2
```

## Upload requirements.txt file 

Please upload your `requirements.txt` file just like you do it with your notebook:

<Screenshot src={uploadPng} alt="Upload files to mercury" />


**Mercury** will automatically read that file and will install all of your packages before opening the notebook.
 

## Install private packages

You can use secrets in the `requirements.txt` file. You can also install packages from private github repositories. Please read about [Secrets Management](/docs/secrets) in our docs for more details.

For example you can install packages from github private repository.

### Add `GITHUB_TOKEN` in Secrets

Please read [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) to know how to get the github token and then add a new secret - GITHUB_TOKEN in [Secrets](/docs/secrets).

### Include `requirements.txt` file

Lastly, write this line in `requirements.txt` file.
```
git+https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/user/project.git@{version}
```

### Upload to Mercury Cloud

Please upload your notebook and `requirements.txt` file to Mercury Cloud.
