# Multiple notebooks

You can serve as many as you want notebooks with Mercury. There is no limit. 
Notebooks are displayed as cards with small preview, `title` and `description` (you can set them with [`App`](/docs/input-widgets/app/) class).
Just click on the title to open selected notebook.

Mercury can serve multiple notebooks to multiple users. If you want to change welcome message please check [documentation](/docs/welcome/) for instructions.
