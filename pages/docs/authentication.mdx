# Authentication

You can share notebooks publicly or with selected users. 

Mercury Site can be shared as:
- Public Site - all notebooks are available publicly, 
- Private Site - all notebooks are available only to users with access rights.

When developing locally with Mercury, there is a default Site created. It is public by default.
There is a default user created with credentials:
- username: `developer@example.com`
- password: `developer`

You can edit default sharing parameters in Mercury Admin Panel. 

## Admin Panel

Please create a super-user account:

```
mercury createsuperuser
```

Please fill needed fields. You will login with `username` and `password`. 

Navigate to `127.0.0.1:8000/admin` to see the Admin Panel:

## Edit Site

Please select `Site` unser `ACCOUNTS`, you should see screen like in the screenshot below:

<Screenshot src={apSelectSitePng} alt="Select Site to edit" />

Please click on Site `ID` and you will see Site details. Please change `Share` field and click `SAVE` in the bottom:

<Screenshot src={apSharePrivatePng} alt="Set share to private for Mercury Site" />

Your Mercury Site is private now. Only authenticated users with proper rights will be able to access notebooks.

## Add users

Adding a new user requires three steps:

1. Please create a new user with `username` and `password`(after selecting `Users` in the left side bar).
2. Please create `Email address` for new user. The address should be `Verfied` and `Primary`.
3. Please create a `Membership` for new user by selecting a new user and Site.


<Callout type="info">
  Sorry if the whole process looks a little too complicated. We are working on Mercury Cloud service, that will serve UI dashboard for managing users and Sites.
