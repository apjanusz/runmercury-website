# Mercury documentation

**Mercury** is an [open-source](https://github.com/mljar/mercury) framework that helps you build web applications from your Jupyter Notebooks.

You can create with Mercury:

  <Card icon={webAppIcon} title="Web App" href="/tutorials/web-app-python-jupyter-notebook"/>
  <Card icon={reportIcon} title="Report (coming soon)" href="/tutorials/report-python-jupyter-notebook"/>

  <Card icon={restApiIcon} title="REST API (coming soon)" href="/tutorials/rest-api-python-jupyter-notebook"/>  
</Cards>

## Mercury modes

Mercury offers set of widgets with simple re-execution of cells in the notebook.

<div className="steps-container">

### Development in Jupyter Notebook 

Mercury comes with set of [Input Widgets](/docs/input-widgets) and [Output Widgets](/docs/output-widgets). 
You can interact with widgets during notebook development. 

Widgets values will be automatically updated. However, **cells below the widget definition code will not be automatically executed** (you need to run them manually).

### Run notebook as Web App in Mercury 

Serve notebook as web application with Mercury. Any widget update will trigger **automatic re-execution of cells**. Not all cells are re-executed.
Only cells with widget definition and below are re-executed.

It allows to speed-up computation and cache previous results.

## Installation

Please install Mercury with the following command:

```
pip install mercury

# or

conda install -c conda-forge mercury
```

Start Mercury Server: 

```
mercury run
``` 

Run Mercury demo:

```
mercury run demo
```

Import Mercury Widgets with the following code:

```python
import mercury as mr
```

## Run demo notebooks

Mercury comes with built-in demo notebooks. You can play with them by running:

```
mercury run demo
```

The above command will create demo notebooks and start development server. Please check the Mercury website at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout type="info">
  You need to have installed `pandas`, `numpy` and `matplotlib` to run demo notebooks.
</Callout>

## Quick Start

Let's build a very simple web app with Mercury. Please create a new Python notebook with the following three code cells.

<div className="steps-container">

### Import Mercury package

```python
import mercury as mr
```

### Add text widget 

```python
name = mr.Text(label="What is your name?")
```

### Print widget value

```python
print(f"Hello {name.value}!")
```
</div>

Please run the following command in the same directory as notebook:

```
mercury run
```

You should see in the web browser at address `http://127.0.0.1:8000` a Mercury website with your notebook.
