# Share Notebooks with Mercury Cloud

It's the easiest way to share notebooks online. You will be able to create a website with few clicks. Deployment is as easy as file upload.

There is a generous free plan (called **Starter**) so you don't need credit card to start. Please check [pricing](/pricing/) website for details.


## 1. Setup account

Please create a new account at [https://cloud.runmercury.com/register](https://cloud.runmercury.com/register).

<Screenshot src={signupPng} alt="Create a new account at RunMercury.com" />

You should get e-mail with varification link. After e-mail verification please login.

## 2. Create first Site 

You login for the first time. There are no Sites available, like in the screenshot below:

<Screenshot src={emptySitesPng} alt="Empty Sites after first login at RunMercury.com" />

Please click `Add Site` to create first Site. 

<Screenshot src={createSitePng} alt="Create a new Site at RunMercury.com" />

The most important things to select here:
- `subdomain` and `domain` - they will define your Site URL.
- `Share` option, you can make your notebooks public or private (available only to invited users).

Click `OK` to add a new Site. You should see the Site information:

<Screenshot src={sitePng} alt="Site information at RunMercury.com" />

You can click on the Site URL addres to open fresh site in separate web tab. In my case it is:

```
https://piotr-notebooks.runmercury.com
```

When you navigate to the Site you will get basic view:

<Screenshot src={piotrWebsitePng} alt="Fresh Site at RunMercury.com" />

## 3. Update Site 

Please click `Edit` button to update your Site:
- you can change your Site `subdomain` and `domain`,
- you can change welcome message,
- you can edit Site visibility.

<Screenshot src={updateSitePng} alt="Update Site" />

Click `OK` and you can refresh your Site to see changes.

## 4. Upload notebooks

Please click on `Files` in the top navigation. You should see empty view:

<Screenshot src={emptyFilesPng} alt="Empty files view" />

Click `Upload files` and upload selected notebooks:

<Screenshot src={uploadFilesPng} alt="Upload files" />

You can also upload:
- `requirements.txt` file with required Python packages,
- data files that are needed in notebooks.

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout type="info">
  If you upload `requirements.txt` file, then required Python packages are installed before your notebook is started.
</Callout>


## 5. Your notebooks are ready!

Please open your Site address and refresh it. You should see your notebooks:
