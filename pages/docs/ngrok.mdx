# Share Mercury local server with ngrok

You can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to share web application. 
The ngrok allows you to expose local server over the Internet. You need to setup ngrok account and install ngrok agent on your machine.

## Mercury Server with ngrok 

1. Start Mercury Server in the directory with notebooks that you would like to share

```
mercury run
```

The Mercury is running local server at `127.0.0.1:8000`. You can set custom IP or port during the start, for example:

```
mercury run 127.0.0.1:8001
```

2. Start ngrok agent with the same port number as used by Mercury Server.

```
ngrok http 8000
```

3. The ngrok agent will display message about fowarding. Please click in the `Forwarding` link.

4. You can share the `Forwarding` link with others. Please be aware that the link is working as long as:
- agent is working,
- and your local server is running. 
If you shout down your computer, the link will not work. 

If you are looking for more persistent way of deployment, please check [Mercury Cloud](https://cloud.runmercury.com).
